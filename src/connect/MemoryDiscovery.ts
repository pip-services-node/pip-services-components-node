/**
 * Discovery service (see [[IDiscovery]]) that stores its registry of connections ([[ConnectionParams]]) in memory. 
 * 
 * Supports both static and dynamic discovery.
 * 
 * - Static discovery: all services have static IP addresses (like a DNS, which also works using static discovery) 
 * that are registered from the start (using [[configure]]) and don't change along the way. As of late, 
 * static discovery has been used more often than dynamic, as it is simpler to use and more reliable 
 * (infrastructure does all of the hard work right out of the box).  
 * 
 * 
 * - Dynamic discovery: every time a service starts, it registers its address in the discovery service ("Service name" 
 * is available at "IP address") using [[register]]. Clients then ask to resolve the address by which the requested 
 * service can be reached. Dynamic discovery is more challenging to use than static discovery: if a service stops working, 
 * its address needs to be refreshed, stale addresses need to be cleaned, heartbeats must be used â€“ many problems and 
 * challenges occur along the way.
