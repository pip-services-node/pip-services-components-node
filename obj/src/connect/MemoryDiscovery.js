 * Discovery service (see {@link IDiscovery}) that stores its registry of connections ({@link ConnectionParams}) in memory.
 *
 * Supports both static and dynamic discovery.
 *
 * - Static discovery: all services have static IP addresses (like a DNS, which also works using static discovery)
 * that are registered from the start (using {@link #configure}) and don't change along the way. As of late,
 * static discovery has been used more often than dynamic, as it is simpler to use and more reliable
 * (infrastructure does all of the hard work right out of the box).
 *
 *
 * - Dynamic discovery: every time a service starts, it registers its address in the discovery service ("Service name"
 * is available at "IP address") using {@link #register}. Clients then ask to resolve the address by which the requested
 * service can be reached. Dynamic discovery is more challenging to use than static discovery: if a service stops working,
 * its address needs to be refreshed, stale addresses need to be cleaned, heartbeats must be used â€“ many problems and
 * challenges occur along the way.
